        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A German classic! Warm potato salad with bacon!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds medium red potatoes, scrubbed and quartered</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>8 ounces thick-cut bacon, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch strips</li>
                <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard, German-style preferred</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons fresh tarragon, finely chopped</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot and fill with cold water to 1-inch above the potatoes. Season the water with 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until a knife gently plunges through the potatoes, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reserve 1/3 cup of the cooking water, drain the potatoes and put back into the pot (off the heat) to keep warm.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, fry the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crispy, stirring occasionally. Reserve the bacon and drain all but 1/4 cup bacon fat.</li>
                <li> Add the onions and saute until slightly golden. Add the vinegar and, with a wooden spoon, scrape up any bits from the bottom of the skillet. Add in the reserved cooking water and reduce until it thickens, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Off the heat, whisk in the mustard and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Add in the potatoes, bacon and tarragon and toss to combine. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
            </ol>
